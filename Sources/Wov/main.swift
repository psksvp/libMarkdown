## The Secret Agenda

Zhao Min turned to look at Zhou Zhiruo with a nod. Then she turned to look toward the high peak on her left. _"Senior Duan should not be far."_ When she did that, her horse slowed down a little until one of the Black Turban Soldiers' horse came close to her. Hence, the soldier's horse was startled and made a sudden stop which caused the soldier to be thrown forward. The soldier quickly grabbed on the neck of the horse but the black mash which covered the face and the head of the soldier was loosened and fell off.

When Zhao Min and Zhou Zhiruo turned to look, they realized then, the soldier was a woman whose skin was as white as a pearl, the nose was straight and long, the eyes were clear Bluegreen. The lips were curved like a longbow.

Other soldiers stopped while the soldier whom her black mesh fell off, quickly jumped from the horse and quickly picked up the mesh to wear. Once she got back on her horse, she said, _"Πριγκίπισσα, πρέπει να προχωρήσουμε γρήγορα, ας συνεχίσουμε."_

Zhao Min could not understand the dialect, but she could see the polite gesture from the soldier and sensed that they wanted her to keep moving. So she turned to look at Zhou Zhiruo and Li Han with a nod.

As they kept traveling eastward, there was less and less tree, the ground became sandy with lot of dry bushes of tall grass. Half an hour after that, they reached a spot overlooking a white sand desert which had no tree nor tall grass bush. The sand was as white as a perl which allowed them to see easily in the dark night. To the east were high peaks with white snow cap lining southward as far as eye could see.


Mean while, at the gazebo by the lake, It had been about 3 hours since Zhao Min left with Li Han. Zhang Wuji had been trying to revive Shahrdar using his divine Nine Yang internal energy, he was sitting behind Shahrdar with both of his palms touching Shahrdar's back. Ruyang Wang stood just behind him while the servants and Dimas were sitting on the ground quietly.

The sun was getting low in the western sky, sound of horses were heading toward the marble house, Ruyang Wang was looking nervously as the horses came closer and closer, he could see two men who were leading a group of about 10 Black Turban Soldiers. They rode to stop in front of the house, Ruyang Wang grabbed Shahrdar's scimitar which was on the ground not far from where Shahrdar and Zhang Wuji were sitting, then he pointed its sharp tip right at Shahrdar's neck.

_"My lord, please don't harm my Khuda ... those are not the enemy."_ Dimas cried. _"They are here to report something to Khuda. I will stop them."_  Then he pushed himself to stand up but his injured leg sent sharp pain to his back and about to fall back down, the servants stood up and held his arms. _"take me to see them, Khuda can't be disturbed at the moment."_ Then he limped with the servants out.

In the same time, Ruyang Wang bent down next to Zhang Wuji. _"son, can this dirt brother of mine be saved? May be, you should not waste your energy, We can run to get MinMin and get out of here."_

Right then, Shahrdar opened his eyes. _"Brother ... Doctor ..."_  He had a few coughs.  _"I should be fine for now. You must get MinMin, I have something, I must talk to her, it's very important, only she can do it."_

Zhang Wuji released his palms from Shahrdar's back. _"Emir Shahrdar, you must not ..."_

_"Doctor, you must get MinMin back here, tell her, she is the only one who can protect the Library and this winery."_ Shahrdar interrupted him.

Zhang Wuji had been worrying about Zhao Min since she left, but he had to stay, unless Shahrdar would not survive. He took a small jar out from his sack and tilted it a little, a small white pill rolled out onto his palm. _"You must take this."_

Shahrdar picked up the pill and looked at Ruyang Wang.

_"Idiot!"_  Ruyang Wang laughed. _"If my son wanted to kill you, you would have been cold already."_

Right then, sounds of argument between Dimas and the two men who rode in with soldiers could be heard. The two men were forcing their way in.

Shahrdar put the pill in his mouth. _"Thank you doctor."_ Then he pushed himself to stand up. _"I will talk to them."_ He held Zhang Wuji's hand and pleaded. _"you must get MinMin."_

Zhang Wuji nodded. _"Emir Shahrdar, you must rest. Do not drink wine ... I will come back and make you medicine."_

Shahrdar smiled and slowly walking toward the front of the house.

_"Father ..."_ Zhang Wuji said.

But Ruyang Wang interrupted him. _"Son, don't worry about me. Go get MinMin!"_

_"Father."_ Zhang Wuji nodded _"please be careful."_ Then he ran, leaped and disappeared toward the wall on the west side of the house.

After that, Ruyang Wang walked toward the front of the house, he went to stand behind the wall which divided the front and the  back of the estate and listened to the conversation between Shahrdar and the two men who rode in. He peeked to see the two men were the Commanders of Shahrdar's Black Turban Army.

_"Khuda ... They are here."_ One of Shahrdar's commander said. _"Our men have met with their forward scouting troop."_

Shahrdar was quiet, he was breathing in and out, his hand was at his left chest.

_"Khuda, are you alright?"_ Dimas limped to hold Shahrdar's arm, but Shahrdar pushed him out hard.

_"I am alright. Leave me!"_ Shahrdar said in anger. He looked up at his generals. _"Can you estimate the size of their force?"_

_"200,000 men, Khuda!"_ The general replied.

_"200,000?"_ Shahrdar exclaimed in surprised tone. _"It can't be. Are you sure?"_

_"They came with the army from Bagdad."_ The general replied.

_"Son of a bitch ... Jahan ...."_ Shahrdar screamed in anger. _"I will show you!"_  He looked up a little.  _"Get our men from Bukhara to setup the perimeter at the river. Notify our men at the dam to release more water."_ Shahrdar gave his command.

_"Yes Khuda."_ One of the two general bowed and ran to get on his horse and rode away.

_"Have you found out where Basu is?"_ Shahrdar asked.

The general shook his head. _"I and my men followed the 3 Red Devil to the lake, then someone helped them escape."_  He moved himself closer to Shahrdar and whispered. _"My men said, it was the `Yellow Witch` who helped them."_

_"Are you certain?"_ Shahrdar whispered his question then he paused and went into his thought.

The general swept his eyes around like he wanted to be sure there was nobody around. _"Khuda, your brother and his daughter, are they?"_

_"you leave that to me to worry."_ Shahrdar replied. _"Get your men out to find out where Basu is. I still don't believe that he would help the old power."_

_"Yes Khuda."_ The General replied before he turned to mount on his horse and rode away.

In the hidden spot behind the wall where Ruyang Wang was hiding, he quickly turned and about to walk back to the gazebo, but he realized, Isa was standing just not far from him, so he walked to pulled Isa's hand to walk with him.

_"What your Holy Lady is trying to do?"_ Ruyang Wang asked.

Isa shook her head. _"WangYe, I am unsure."_ She replied. _"I was told to protect WangYe."_

Ruyang Wang squeezed Isa's hand harder like he was threatening to harm her. _"Are you telling me the truth?"_

_"ouch!"_ Isa screamed in pain. _"yes ... I am hurt."_

Ruyang Wang calmed down, he let go of Isa's hand. _"Is my daughter in any danger?"_

_"WangYe ..."_ Isa wiped a drop of tear at the end of her eye. _"I was not told anything. My responsibility is to ensure WangYe's safety."_

Right then, Shahrdar walked back in, Dimas and the other servants were with him. They stopped just at the rear door of the house where Shahrdar was talking to Dimas for a moment, then Dimas limped away before he rode out on a horse. After that, the servants walked with Shahrdar back to the gazebo.

When Shahrdar got to the gazebo, Ruyang Wang walked to stand in front of Shahrdar and grabbed Shahrdar by the neck. _"Tell me, how could the Mani mobilize 200,000 men?"_

_"Brother please ..."_ Shahrdar coughed. _"We are in the same boat now."_ He grabbed Ruyang Wang's hand which held at his neck. _"killing me now won't help."_

Ruyang Wang eased the grip on the hand which grabbed at Shahrdar's neck. _"Then talk!"_

Shahrdar pulled Ruyang Wang's hand out from his neck, then he had a few more cough. His face turned pale as he sat down. The servants and Isa ran to help Shahrdar and kept asking if he was all right. A moment later, Shahrdar had a sip of tea. _"Brother ... you see ... I am not the bad guy here."_ He explained in tired tone. _"The past two months, I think, you've seen what I am doing here is not what you might have thought."_

Ruyang Wang was looking at Shahrdar with an untrusting expression shown on his face. _"In this kind of situation MinMin always told me to not trusting what I hear and what I see."_

Shahrdar had a tired and weak long sighed. _"Brother, without your doctor son in law, I would have been a cold corpse by now. At this moment, you must believe me, I mean no harm by inviting you and MinMin here."_

_"Tell me exactly why do you want MinMin here?"_ Ruyang Wang was still using his threatening tone.

_"Brother, as you have seen, I am not well."_ Shahrdar replied. _"First, I need a capable person like MinMin to look after this Winery."_ He had another cough, then he glanced at the tall peaks on the east, _"Second, there is a very important place which I also must find someone to look after."_


_"Important place?"_ Ruyang Wang went on his puzzling tone.
 

_"Brother ... please ..."_ Shahrdar said and had a tired cough, his face was pale, his body started swaying like he was going to fall from where he sat. The servants quickly came to hold his arms. _"I must talk with MinMin."_ Then he closed his eyes.

_"Khuda, Khuda ..."_ Dimas and the servants kept calling.

_"He is fine ..."_ Ruyang Wang said in a tone. _"He won't die, my son already fixed him. He need to rest. Bring him inside and let him rest."_

Dimas and the servants nodded, then they held Shahrdar up and moved him into the house.

Ruyang Wang turned to look at the lake, he whispered. _"MinMin, what is it that's so important until this ..."_ he turned to glance at Shahrdar who was being carried away before he signed and turned back to look at the lake.

Late that same evening, the sun had already gone below the horizon, however, the western sky was still emitting orange glow, Zhao Min, Zhou Zhiruo and Li Han were about 100 Li southeast of the Winery. They were riding with a large group of the Black Turban Soldiers. These group of soldier was not the same group as those who stationed at Bukhara.

Jaluman whom Ouyang Xiu had identified as the top commander of this fraction of the Black Turban Soldiers, did not say anything to Zhao Min nor Zhou Zhiruo, he just kept glancing at them with annoying and untrusting expression on his face.

About half an hour later, they were told to stop. Zhao Min, Zhou Zhiruo and Li Han were isolated from the main group of the soldiers and their commander. Another group of soldiers rode in to escort them away from the main group which kept traveling westward. These soldiers had a dark mesh covered their face, none carried the Spiky Ball Chain which was the signature weapon of the Black Turban Soldiers.

As the sun went deep below the horizon, the sky had turned completely dark, there were still traveling eastward. None of the soldiers had said anything to them nor answered any questions which Zhao Min tried to ask.

_"MinMin ..."_ Zhou Zhiruo projected her voice. _"Have you been keeping track of where we have been."_

Zhao Min turned to look at Zhou Zhiruo with a nod. Then she turned to look toward the high peak on her left. _"Senior Duan should not be far."_ When she did that, her horse slowed down a little until one of the Black Turban Soldiers' horse came close to her. Hence, the soldier's horse was startled and made a sudden stop which caused the soldier to be thrown forward. The soldier quickly grabbed on the neck of the horse but the black mash which covered the face and the head of the soldier was loosened and fell off.

When Zhao Min and Zhou Zhiruo turned to look, they realized then, the soldier was a woman whose skin was as white as a pearl, the nose was straight and long, the eyes were clear Bluegreen. The lips were curved like a longbow.

Other soldiers stopped while the soldier whom her black mesh fell off, quickly jumped from the horse and quickly picked up the mesh to wear. Once she got back on her horse, she said, _"Πριγκίπισσα, πρέπει να προχωρήσουμε γρήγορα, ας συνεχίσουμε."_

Zhao Min could not understand the dialect, but she could see the polite gesture from the soldier and sensed that they wanted her to keep moving. So she turned to look at Zhou Zhiruo and Li Han with a nod.

As they kept traveling eastward, there was less and less tree, the ground became sandy with lot of dry bushes of tall grass. Half an hour after that, they reached a spot overlooking a white sand desert which had no tree nor tall grass bush. The sand was as white as a perl which allowed them to see easily in the dark night. To the east were high peaks with white snow cap lining southward as far as eye could see.

About 5 Li south of where they were, they could see camps which lined up from west to east. Zhao Min was startled to see because it was as long as her eyes could see.

_"MinMin!"_ Zhou Zhiruo said. _"Are those the Mani cult army?"_ Her tone showed disbelieving and startling thought.

_"Zhiruo, I didn't expect this."_ Zhao Min shook her head, her face showed, she had a big worry in her heart. _"If I guess, it's the army of Jahan Khan from Bagdad."_ She replied while she was still looking toward the camps. _"The Winery has become their greatest threat."_

_"We need to change our plan, if Mani does not command them."_ Zhou Zhiruo projected her voice to Zhao Min.

Then one of the Black Turban soldiers who had been escorting them said. _"Πριγκίπισσα, ακολούθησέ με με αυτόν τον τρόπο."_

From the hand gesture of the soldier, both Zhao Min and Zhou Zhiruo could guess, the soldier wanted them to follow. However, Zhao Min suddenly asked, _"Li Han, don't you want to go wee?"_

Li Han who had been sitting on the horse in front of Zhou Zhiruo turned to look at Zhao Min with a little puzzling expression.

Zhao Min was looking at Li Han with a big smile while her head was nodding.

Li Han noticed the nodding was some kind of signal from Zhao Min, so he straight his head up, _"Yes, I need to wee."_ Then he quickly jumped down the horse and used both his palms to cover around the area near his private part.

When the soldiers saw what Li Han was doing, they talked to each others, then five rode out toward the camps while the rest waited.

_"Junzhu ..."_ Li Han said. _"It's dark, I am scared. Can you come with me?"_

_"Alright ..."_ Zhao Min dismounted and walked Li Han toward a tall bush of dry grass. _"I will wait here."_

Li Han nodded and walked to be behind Zhao Min.

In the same time, Zhao Min reached her hand to her belt pocket on her back. _"Set it to go up in 10 minute."_ She whispered. _"Make sure to aim it to the northeast."_ Then she passed a small metal tube to Li Han who then, walked and disappeared behind the tall bush of dry grass.

Zhao Min stood there quietly. _"Senior Duan, please be there, I need you."_ She was thinking quietly, but her eyes were looking at Zhou Zhiruo who was also looking at her.

Less than 5 minute later, Li Han walked back. _"Junzhu, It's all done."_

Zhao Min smiled and held his hand before they walked back to the horse. Then they rode out toward the camp.

<center>—— ^｡ꞈ｡^ ——</center>

That same night, a bit earlier before Li Han went to wee, Duan Zhengkang was sitting quietly on the ridge. He was thinking about what Liu Biyu and Wei Yixiao had told him about the Gaibang in Bukhara when suddenly Li Sicui ran from behind him.

_"Duan Gongzhi."_ Li Sicui said quietly. _"Please come with me this way, you must see this."_

_"What is it?"_ Duan Zhengkang asked like he did not want to follow Li Sicui, because he was worrying about the wooden box which he secured it down on the ground in front of him.

_"Situation might have changed."_ Li Sicui said. _"This was about the time which Junzhu should have signaled us already."_

Duan Zhengkang looked up in the night sky for a short moment, he realized then, it was true like what Li Sicui said. He quickly pulled the wooden box out from the ground and carried it back to his horse. _"Hero Li, I am ready."_ Then he mounted onto his horse.

Li Sicui took Duan Zhengkang along the ridge further southward. About half an hour later, they saw the white sand desert below them on the southwest.  A bit further in the desert, they saw a large camp, consisting of more than 2000 yurts.

_"According to what Junzhu estimated, the Mani cult army shouldn't be this large."_ Duan Zhengkang exclaimed in surprised tone.

_"Duan Gongzhi ..."_ Li Sicui pointed his index finger toward an area where the desert met with tall dry grass area. A small firework was going up, it was emitting a green long tail as it moved up.

_"Junzhu is changing her plan?"_ Duan Zhengkang said in wondering tone, in the same time, he pulled his scope out and looked through it. He aimed the scope toward the white sand desert area.

_"Duan Gongzhi, Is Junzhu in any danger?"_ Li Sicui asked.

Duan Zhengkang did not reply, he kept his eye at the scope and slowly moving it like he was tracking something. A moment later, he said, _"Zhou Jiaomen is with her."_ Then he passed the scope to Li Sicui and pointed his index finger toward a spot in the white sand desert.

Li Sicui was looking for a moment. _"Duan Gongzhi, those are not the Mani Cult Army."_ He passed the scope back to Duan Zhengkang. _"The insignia on the flags indicates, they are the soldiers of Jahan Khan from Bagdad. "_

_"Jahan Khan!"_ Duan Zhengkang was surprised. _"Hasn't Bagdad broken tied with the Halaku house?"_  He was talking to himself and went into his thought for a moment, then he turned to look at Li Sicui directly. _"I feel, Junzhu and Zhou Jiaomen are in danger. We must go down there."_

Li Sicui nodded, he ran to his horse to get the two more arrow sockets. In the same time, Duan Zhengkang ran to take the wooden box from the sack at his horse, he wrapped it with a piece of cloth, so he could carry the box by tying the cloth from his shoulder to his back. After that, both rushed southward along the ridge.



<!--  _"Hero Li, Junzhu's father is still in the Winery, you must go and escort him out as soon as possible. Bukhara's army won't be able to match with the Imperial Jahan Khan's army."_

_"But Duan Gongzhi, Junzhu has not clearly indicated that she wants a change of her plan."_ Li Sicui was reluctant.

_"Hero Li, you mustn't delay, Jahan Khan has been wanting to get rid of Emir Shahrdar for quite sometimes, those soldiers will flatten Bukhara into the ground soon."_  Duan Zhengkang said. _"Tell Wuji to get out with WangYe as soon as possible. I will get Junzhu and Zhou Jiaomen."_

Li Sicui had a quick glance at the scene of the giant army camp before he nodded and ran back to his horse and rode out northward along the ridge.

In the same time, Duan Zhengkang ran to take the wooden box from the sack at his horse, he wrapped it with a piece of cloth, so he could carry the box by tying the cloth from his shoulder to his back. After that using his QingGong, he leaped and bounced down from the ridge toward the white sand desert.  -->

Concurrently, down in the white sand desert, Zhao Min, Zhou Zhiruo and Li Han were approaching a large yurt on the east side.

They rode to stop about 50 meter before the entrance of a large yurt. Zhao Min swept her eyes around the area, she saw many other yurts which she guessed, they were used to house the soldiers.

The soldiers who had been escorting them dismounted and walked to hold the holding rope for Zhao Min and Zhou Zhiruo. _"Πριγκίπισσα, ηρωίδα"_ One said and bowed at Zhao Min and Zhou Zhiruo. _"Είμαστε εδώ."_

_"GoGo, what is this place?"_ Li Han whispered.

_"don't worry, Li Han"_  Zhou Zhiruo replied. _"Currently, We are safe."_

Li Han nodded, _"I wonder if uncle Zhang and uncle Yu are here."_

_"I believe so."_ Zhou Zhiruo replied before she dismounted. Li Han followed.

After that, the soldiers walked their horse away. As they stood there, three people rushed out from the big yurt. One wore Persian dress while the other twos wore black uniform with their face covered with black mesh. When they got to where Zhao Min, Zhou Zhiruo and Li Han were standing, they quickly went on their knees.

_"Junzhu, Zhou Jiaomen ... er ... thank heaven, you are safe."_  The one who wore Persian dress said in the Central Plain language. Her voice showed, she was a little uncomfortable talking with Zhao Min and Zhou Zhiruo. _"when I found out, Junzhu and Zhou Jiaomen arrived at Bukhara, I asked my subordinate to find you to ensure your safety."_

_"Minoo ... How have you been?"_ Zhao Min used her pretending surprised voice. _"It's been just about a month, you've changed a lot. You are now, commanding your own subordinates!"_ She made direct eye contact with Minoo. _"Where is Wushu?"_ Her tone changed to very serious.

_"Junzhu, Zhou Jiaomen ... "_ Minoo said. _"Please come inside. I and sister will explain everything."_
   
_"Where is Wushu?"_ Zhao Min asked again.

_"Junzhu ..."_ Minoo stood up, _"Please come inside, I will explain."_

Zhao Min turned to look at Zhou Zhiruo who nodded back at her. Then she started walking toward the yurt, Zhou Zhiruo held Li Han's hand and followed Zhao Min. Minoo and the two soldiers quickly followed behind.


<center>—— ^｡ꞈ｡^ ——</center>

When they got close to the giant yurt, there were many guards, each dressed in black with mash covered their face. Zhao Min noticed, there were all women. To the west of where the giant yurt was, there were many small yurts which were used to house the other soldiers who wore no mesh to cover their face, just a black turban. That area was fenced off from the main giant yurt.

Inside the giant yurt, it was grand and was decorated like a palace. The half of the circular shape of the yurt was blocked off by a partition made from big piece of black silk.

When Zhao Min, Zhou Zhiruo and Li Han got inside, there were many servants, all were intensely looking at at Zhao Min and Zhou Zhiruo.

_"Junzhu, please wait here ..."_ Minoo said quietly. _"I will notify sister."_ Then she ran into the other half of the yurt behind the partition.

While waiting, Zhao Min and Zhou Zhiruo heard sound of baby intermittently crying from behind the partition.

_"That must be younger brother JunMing."_ Li Han whispered.

Zhou Zhiruo glanced at him and smile, she gently squeezed his hand two times.

Right then, one of the servant announced something in a language which Zhao Min did not understand. When all the other servants heard, they quickly went on the floor and faced down. Each spoke something like chanting in a language which Zhao Min did not understand.

A lady walked out from behind the partition. Minoo was following behind. She was walking straight toward where Zhao Min, Zhou Zhiruo and Li Han were standing.

_"Junzhu, Zhou Jiaomen."_ The Lady called in a tone which showed she was glad to see Zhao Min and Zhou Zhiruo. While she was still walking, suddenly she paused, she glanced left and right at the servants who were sitting on the floor. She stood straight and turned to glance at Minoo who stood just behind her. Then Minoo spoke something loudly.

When the servant heard, they stood up and started walking out from the yurt. Minoo ensured, there was nobody left by walking to the door and gave an order for the guard to not letting anyone in.

Right after that, the lady quickly walked to hold Zhao Min's and Zhou Zhiruo's hand. _"Junzhu, Zhou Jiaomen ... I am so glad, you are safe."_

Zhao Min stood quietly and smiled.

_"XiaoZhao ..."_ Zhou Zhiruo asked. _"Why would Junzhu be in any danger? I am with her."_

Minoo quickly walked back from the entrance door, _"Junzhu, brother JunYu and my husband are coming with Hero Zhang and Hero Yu."_

_"Is it true?"_ Li Han exclaimed. _"where are they? They are poisoned and urgently need the antidote."_

_"Young Master ..."_ Minoo said. _"They should be here soon. Both heroes have been given the antidote."_

_"Sister Zhou."_ XiaoZhao said. _"Those Red Devils, where did you hide them?"_

Zhao Min turned to look at Zhou Zhiruo, _"Red Devils?"_
